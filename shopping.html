    <div> 1. Name a situation where you would need to create an "if" statement.  (There are many answers to this question.) </div>
    <div> 2. When comparing values,  in what data type is the result stored? (number, string, or Boolean?) </div>
    <h1> Answers </h1>
    <div> 1. For instance if you had a prompt, and you wanted to execute different code depending on if the user clicks OK or cancel
    <div> 2. Boolean (i.e. if the result is false, the code in the if statement isnt executed)



    <script>
        let total = prompt("How much did you spend?") //allowing user to enter their total
        let confirmed = confirm("$" + total + " total is correct? Click OK to continue") //confirming input value of user. it doesn't actually allow the user to return to the previous prompt but the project page says this will be addressed later
        if (total < 50) alert("No discount") //if total is less than 50, will display that they have no discount
        if (50 <= total) { //coding for if total is greater than 50, branching for different discount tiers
            if (total < 100) alert("10% off")
            else alert("20% off")
        }
